# Hi! I'm ISU a student from Mexico


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Systems Engineering student in Mexico.

My favorite hobby is learning new codes and practicing them.

I like trying to create my own projects or in groups.

I enjoy web development and databases.

Spanish is my native language, I like to practice English a lot.
